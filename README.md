## Simple API System
This is a simple API endpoint that gets a country and displays the list of services it offers along with their prices. This API was built using the lastest version of Laravel which is version 12.

For example, to view the servcies offered in Brazil, the API endpoint will be http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/country-services?country=Brazil and you will see the services and price.

To see all services, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/country-services

## API Documentation

I included an API documentation using a free library called Scribe. You can access the documentation here http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs and also test all the API endpoints.
